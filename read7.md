This book explains how JavaScript can be used
in browsers to make websites more interactive,
interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about
jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.

# WRITING A SCRIPT 
Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking
about them too much, for example you might be
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.
Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler.

Just like learning any new language, you need
to get to grips with the:
- Vocabulary: The words that computers
understand
- Syntax: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow
Along with learning the language itself, if you are
new to programming, you will also need to learn how
a computer achieves different types of goals using
a programmatic approach to problem-solving.

# EXPRESSIONS 

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN AVALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

# OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 

- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
- STRING OPERATORS 
- COMPARISON OPERATORS 
- LOGICAL OPERATORS

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

# ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS

Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected.
If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression,
(e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression. 

A **function declaration** creates a function that you
can call later in your code. It is the type of function
you have seen so far in this book.

If you put a function where the interpreter would
expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an
expression, and it is known as a **function expression**.
