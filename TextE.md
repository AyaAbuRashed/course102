# Choosing A Text Editor

When I first started out learning about web development, one of the
things that I felt compelled to do was to download a text editor. I
figured that I was going to be writing a good deal of code, and a good
text editor should help me do that.

I don’t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. Yes,
some text editing software comes with features that other text editing
software does not. But for the most part, they’re all pretty similar.

While you can search on Google for the “best” text editor for coding
(and Google will definitely tell you). I think the best text editor is
truly the one that you enjoy using the most. Notepad++ really the best one,
isn’t it?

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

 # The Difference Between Text
Editors and IDEs

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the titleit edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files.

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
