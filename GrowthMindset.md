# What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

# How you can benefit from a growth mindset

The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
