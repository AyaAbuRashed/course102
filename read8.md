# Comparison and logical operators

## USING COMPARISON OPERATORS

At the most basic level, you can
evaluate two variables using a
comparison operator to return a
t rue or f al se value.
In this example, a user is taking a
test, and the script tells the user
whether they have passed this
round of the test.

# USING LOGICAL OPERATOR

In this example, a math test
has tworounds.Foreach round
there are two variables: one
holds the user's score for that
round; the other holds the pass
mark for that round. 
The example finishes off by
letting the user know whether
or not they have passed both
rounds or one of them .

# KEY LOOP CONCEPTS 
Here are three points to consider when you
are working with loops. Each is illustrated in
examples on the following three pages. 

KEYWORDS
You will commonly see these
two keywords used with loops:
break
This keyword causes the
termination of the loop and tells
the interpreter to go onto the
next statement of code outside
of the loop. (You may also see it
used in functions.)
continue
This keyword tells the interpreter
to continue with the current
iteration, and then check the
condition again. (If it is true, the
code runs again.)
