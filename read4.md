# How Pages Use Structure

Think about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long
piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate
sections or quotes from those
involved. Structure helps readers
understand the stories in the
newspaper.

The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is
illustrated on the right with a
copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its
website.

# HTML Describes the Structure of Pages

In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want
to appear on the page.
You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what
the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next
page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen
is in black.

<html>
<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>

The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

## HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages


Let's look closer at the code from the last page.
There are several different elements. Each
element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

# HTML5 Layout

- HTML5 layout elements
- How old browsers understand new elements
- Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS

HTML5 is introducing a new set of
elements that help define the structure of
a page.
They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page. These
new elements are going to play an important part in creating
layouts going forward.

# Process & Design

- How to approach building a site
- Understanding your audience and their needs
- How to present information visitors want to see

---
This section discusses a process that
you can use when you are creating a new
website.


It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:

- How to understand the audience your site may attract and
what information they will expect to find on it
- How to organize information so that visitors can find what
they are looking for
- Design theory for presenting information in a way that
helps visitors achieve their goals
- Design tips to help you create more attractive and
professional sites

# Who is the Site For?

Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

# Target Audience: Companies
- What is the size of the company or relevant department?
- What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
- How large is the budget they control?

# Why People Visit YOUR Website

Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
