Everywhere you look, computers are changing the world whether they are on our desktop, in our home,our pokets,or just about anywhere else..but while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily, 
We don't often ask 
# how do computers work? 
Starting with what makes a computer a computer then, you will look at how information is represented inside the computer using tiny electrical signals going on and off at mind-boggling speeds.
After that you will learn how computers use circuits to do everything from simple math to simulation entire virtual worlds.

# Milling machine
Can you build a desktop milling machine a milling machine takes a rotating cutting tool and moves it through material to create a 3D object under the hood all computers do the same for basic me and put information store and process the information I meant to send I just been tied at the computer there are input devices that just input from the outside world M converted into binary information there is no information there is a central processing unit or CPU for all the calculations are done and finally there are two devices that take information and converted into a favorite outfit let's talk about them put  the first computers can take many different types of input like the keyboard of a computer that touchpad of a phone camera a microphone or a GPS but even the sensors on a car a thermostat or a drone are also different input devices now let's look at a simple example of how input travels through computer and becomes output when you press a key on your keyboard let's say the letter P the keyboard converts the letter to a number that number is sent as binary ones and zeros into the computer starting from this number to see if you calculate how to display the letter B pixel-by-pixel the CPU request step by step instructions from memory would chill out how to draw the letter B to see if you run C instructions and stores the results as pixels in memory finally this pixel information is sent in binary to the screen the screen is an output device which converts to Binary signals into the tiny lines and colors that make up what you see these all happens so quickly if you have an instantaneous but to display each letter at computer runs thousands of instructions,starting from the moment your finger presses the starting from the moment your finger presses the.

# how computers work 

You may have heard that computers work on ones and zeros or you may have seen scary looking visuals like this actually deals directly with these ones and zeros ones and zeros of Jew play a big role in how computers work on the inside inside a computer art the electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in the computer how do you store a represent formation using electricity that's not a lot of choices but it's a really important start with one wire we can represent a yes or no true or false a 1 or 0 for anything else with only two options with on-off statements single wire on the pit and it's the smallest piece of information or more wires more ones and zeros with morbid you can represent information to understand that we need to learn about something called the binary number system in the decimal number system pick up 10 digits from 0 to 9 and that's how we've all learn to count in the binary number system we don't have two digits 0 and 1 with these two digits we can count up to any number just how this works in the decimal number system
